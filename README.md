# ‚úâÔ∏è LangGraph Email Assistant

A smart, production-ready email assistant built using [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) and integrated with Gmail and Google Calendar via Auth0. This assistant is designed to simplify email workflows by:

-  **Classifying** incoming emails as: (respond, ignore, notify)
-  **Drafting responses** to emails intelligently
-  **Scheduling meetings** with context from the conversation
-  **Remembering cross-thread context** using semantic long-term memory
-  Fully secure with Google OAuth authentication through **Auth0**

## Features

- ‚úÖ Real-time email classification
- ‚úÖ Smart response drafting
- ‚úÖ Meeting scheduling via Google Calendar
- ‚úÖ Semantic memory for contextual awareness across threads
- ‚úÖ Can handle user commands like sending emails, retrieving the last sent email, and more
- üîú Future: Episodic and procedural memory integration for even more personalized, adaptive behavior

## How It Works

The LangGraph-powered assistant uses a graph-based architecture to manage its workflow. Key components include:

### Detect Email Received Node
- This node is responsible for detecting if the input is related to a received email or a general user request.
- If it detects a received email, it forwards it to the Triage Router Node.
- If it detects a simple request (like asking for the last sent email or sending a new email), it forwards it directly to the React Agent.

### Triage Router Node
- This node is responsible for deciding what to do with each incoming email.
- Based on the email's content and metadata, it routes the message to one of three paths:
  - `Respond`
  - `Ignore`
  - `Notify`

### React Agent Node
- If the Triage Router decides the assistant should respond, it forwards the email to a React Agent.
- This agent composes a reply by analyzing context, thread history, and memory.
- It is also capable of handling various user requests, such as:
  - Sending an email to a specified recipient
  - Telling the user the last email they sent
  - Summarizing recent conversations
  - And much more

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Install [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager:**

   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```

---

### Local Setup

Follow these steps to get the project running locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/langgraph-email-assistant.git
   cd langgraph-email-assistant
   ```

2. **Create your environment file:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Update it with your Auth0, Gmail, and Calendar credentials.

3. **Set up the virtual environment:**

   a. Create and activate the environment:

   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

   b. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   uv run
   ```

4. **Run the LangGraph development server:**

   ```bash
   uv pip install "langgraph-cli[inmem]"
   uv run langgraph dev
   ```

### Google Auth Setup

To enable Gmail and Calendar integration, you‚Äôll need to set up your OAuth credentials. Follow this tutorial to create your `credentials.json` and `token.json`:

 [Google OAuth Setup Guide](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials)

Once created, place them in:

```bash
src/agent/credentials/
```

## What's Next?

We're planning to enhance the assistant's memory using:

### Episodic Memory

- Stores **experiences and sequences** from previous tasks
- Enables the assistant to "recall how" it performed a task
- Supports **few-shot learning** for behavior adaptation

### Procedural Memory

- Encodes **rules and routines** the assistant follows
- Typically lives in **code, prompt templates, or configurations**
- Provides consistency across sessions

> Just like humans remember both *how* to ride a bike (procedural) and *a memorable bike ride* (episodic), our assistant will evolve to remember both the *rules* and *experiences* to be more helpful.
